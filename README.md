* http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2563632/how-can-i-merge-two-commits-into-one in an attempt to merge the first two commits into one single "initial commit"

### I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

### Comments:
I completed the initial commit and tagged it v0.1, but then I decided to change my .editorconfig file to have spaces instead of tabs. I continued on with the assignment branching all of the different branches out from the master branch at the "changed the .editorconfig" commit. However, I wanted to combine the initial commit with the "changed the .editorconfig" commit and have them both under a single initial commit under the master branch with the v0.1 tag. I was not able to figure out how to do this, so after playing around with the terminal, I decided to just move the v0.1 tag to the second commit, or the "changed the .editorconfig" commit.
